# Tools for working with Cooklang

[cooklang][] is a cool recipe markup language, with a reference implementation in Swift.
These are some tools intended for personal used based around an alternative parser in Python.

I want to use this to:
- Generate a recipe site from cooklang recipes
- Add ingredients for a recipe to a shopping list in todo.txt format

If cooklang looks interesting to you, the official implementation is what you're looking for.
Check it out, it's pretty cool!
